/**
 *  Configuration file to define URL to action mapping
 *
 *  This file contains one or more PHP statements that call
 *  {@link Router::connect() $router->connect()} to add routes to the
 *  route table stored in the {@link Router} object pointed to by
 *  $router.
 *
 *  Add your own custom routes here.
 *  The priority is based upon order of creation: first created ->
 *  highest priority. 
 *
 *  Here's a sample route:
 *  $router->connect( "products/:id",
 *                    array(":controller" => "catalog",
 "                    :action" => "view") ); 
 *
 *  You can have the root of your site routed by hooking up "".
 *  Just remember to delete public_html/index.html.
 *  $router->connect( "", array(":controller" => "welcome") );
 *
 *  Install the default route as the lowest priority.
