== Welcome to Trax

Trax is a web-application and persistance framework that includes everything
needed to create database-backed web-applications according to the
Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also
called the presentation) into "dumb" templates that are primarily responsible
for inserting pre-build data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
"smart" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all
the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The
controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update
Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.

In Trax, the model is handled by what's called a object-relational mapping
layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from
database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
methods. 

The controller and view is handled by the Action Controller

== Requirements

* Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc) (uses Pear::MDB2)
* PHP 5.x
* PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::Mail, PEAR::Mail_mime

* FreeBSD, Unix, Linux, MacOSX, Windows

== This Standalone Download of Trax Instructions
Included with this are all the PEAR Modules needed and Edge Trax
that can be updated from in the vendor/trax folder bye typing "svn up".

1. Edit public/.htaccess and set the include_path to where your 
   Trax config folder is located.
   php_value include_path .:/home/username/trax/config
2. Since this is standalone you have to also set at the top of the 2 commandline
   scripts in the Trax "script" folder the location of your php binary 
   if you want to use the console or generator.
   Example: 
     #! /usr/local/bin/php
     <?php
3. Set your Apache Vhost or servers DocumentRoot to where your 
   Trax "public" folder is located. If you don't have access to change
   Apache then you can place all the contents of the Trax "public" folder
   in your main publicly accessible folder on your server.  
   For example: public_html. 
   If you don't want it in your main folder you can even put the contents of the "public"
   folder in a new sub-folder in your main publicly accesible folder on your
   server.  For example, public_html/manager
